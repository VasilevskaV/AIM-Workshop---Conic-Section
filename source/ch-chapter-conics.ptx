  <title>Conics</title>

  <introduction>
   <p>
            In this chapter, we will study the special curves called conic sections. These shapes are 
            very important because they describe how planets move in space and how light reflects 
            off mirrors.

            In the first section, we will learn about the ellipse, which is a stretched-out circle that shows 
            the path planets take around the sun. In the second section, we
            will study the hyperbola, a curve that describes the path of objects that 
            fly past a planet and never come back. Finally, we will learn 
            how to use polar coordinates to describe all these shapes using simple rules 
            about distance and angles.
